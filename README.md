# <h1>API Weather Dashboard</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>To create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly

<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Create a weather dashboard with form inputs</li>
   <ul>
    <li>When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</li>
    <li>When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:</li>
     <ul>
      <li>The city name</li>
      <li>The date</li>
      <li>An icon representation of weather conditions</li>
      <li>The temperature</li>
      <li>The humidity</li>
      <li>The wind speed</li>
     </ul>
    <li>When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:</li>
     <ul>
      <li>The date</li>
      <li>An icon representation of weather conditions</li>
      <li>The temperature</li>
      <li>The humidity</li>
     </ul>
    <li>When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>For this weeks challenge I spent time researching localStorage by watching YouTube demonstrations. I also took time going over the code presented to us in class for that week.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>It is worthwhile adding comments to your code for when you come back to work on it as a later date</li>
